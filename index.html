      Most large sports events came to an abrupt halt during the pandemic, but one category was not only unaffected but
      enjoyed <a

      growth</a>: esports. Esports is the competitive playing of video games such as League of Legends, Fortnite
      and Fifa Football.

    <p>
      The audiences for the biggest titles <a
      href="https://www.businessinsider.com/esports-ecosystem-market-report?r=US&IR=T">are now enormous</a>.
      Fortnite alone has around 78 million monthly players and professional tournaments draw in many millions of
      online spectators. League of Legends World Championship attracted over 100 million viewers in 2019 with a peak
      of 44 million. In comparison, the Wimbledon men‚Äôs final 2019 peaked at around <a
      href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/48989639">9 million viewers</a>.

      It‚Äôs not just the size of the audience that‚Äôs different, it‚Äôs also their age. The average tennis spectator is 61,
      whereas esports spectators are on <a

      Major bookmakers such as PaddyPower, Bet365 and Betway, along with many niche operators, are now offering bets on
      esports tournaments. Monthly esports betting revenues for UK operators <a

      This explosive growth has been fuelled by online advertising, which almost <a

      The danger is that younger people are being drawn to gamble on esports. In 2019, <a
      href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/PDF/survey-data/Gambling-participation-in-2019-behaviour-awareness-and-attitudes.pdf">17%
      of esports gamblers</a> were aged 18-24. In general, <a

      and more</a> UK 16-34-year-olds are gambling, and the average age of gamblers <a
      href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/PDF/survey-data/Gambling-participation-in-2019-behaviour-awareness-and-attitudes.pdf">is
      decreasing</a>. The number of problem gamblers aged 11-16 <a
      href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46286945">has also quadrupled</a> to more than 50,000 in just two
      years. This comes at a time when <a href="https://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/report/gaming-the-system/">93% of

      There is scant research into whether esports gaming leads to gambling, but <a

      study</a> in 2019 found children heavily engaged with tweets from esports bookmakers and their affiliates.
      And regulators can‚Äôt keep up. During the recent <a

      into gambling, Guy Parker, chief executive of the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), admitted he finds it
      almost impossible to track and regulate online gambling advertising.

    <h2>Esports betting adverts and children</h2>
    <p><a
      href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/media-library/sites/news/2019/aug/D1261_Horne_DEMOS_Management%20report_2019_web.pdf">Our
      research</a>, sponsored by GambleAware and in collaboration with Ipsos MORI, the thinktank Demos and the
      University of Sussex, analysed 880,000 tweets from 417 UK-based accounts related to gambling operators. We
      looked at data from their 621,000 UK-based followers, and the 166,969 UK-based individuals who engaged with
      these tweets by commenting, liking or sharing them. We analysed tweets related to both traditional sports and
      esports betting, with the latter making up about a tenth of the accounts studied.
    </p>
    <p>
      We identified three particular concerns. First, people following esport gambling accounts are very young. We
      found that 17% of followers were under 16, and another 69% were aged 16-23. In other words, 85% of esports
      betting-account followers are under 24. The same is true for those commenting on, liking or sharing these
      tweets: 28% were under 16, and 66% were aged 16-23.

      Second, the advertising techniques used by gambling operators are somewhat different from those used for
      traditional sports (with an older audience). Rather than getting people to sign up or make impulsive gambles by
      offering ‚Äúfree bets‚Äù, ‚Äúmatched bets‚Äù or ‚Äúsign-up bonuses‚Äù, esports betting appears to concentrate much more on
      tweets that are funny, using gifs, memes and esports insider-knowledge.
   </p>
    <p>This content doesn‚Äôt look like a hard sell or an incitement to gamble. Children <a
      href="https://www.ama.org/discussions/mppc20proceedings-digitalmarketing-poster2/">might not even
      realise</a> it is commercial content designed to make them part with their money, and might do little to
      resist.

    <p>
      Funny stuff is also highly shareable. As these posts are circulated on social media, more children ‚Äì who may have
      previously had no interest in gambling - are inadvertently looped in. So while gambling is illegal for many
      engaging with these adverts, with a minimum age of 18 in the UK, a positive image is slowly and implicitly
      building in the back of their minds.

      Third, when our researchers analysed a sample of all the tweets in depth, many appeared to contravene the UK‚Äôs <a
      href="https://www.asa.org.uk/type/non_broadcast/code_section/16.html">CAP gambling advertising code</a>. We
      found esports gambling tweets that used cartoons and animated characters, associated themselves with youth
      culture or featured esports stars under 25 years old. All of this activity breaches the code.

      <a href="https://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1336&context=gaming_institute">Other
      research</a> has highlighted issues with gambling advertising potentially appealing to children, but our
      focus on esports highlights a worrying trend that has been under the radar of researchers and policymakers.
    </p>
    <h2>Next steps</h2>
    <p>
      With the pandemic unlikely to disappear soon, esports playing, following and betting will continue to grow. We
      need to act now to stop social-media advertising turning children‚Äôs gaming into gambling.
    </p>
    <p>
      After reading our research, the Gambling Commission and ASA sent all UK esports betting operators <a
      href="https://www.asa.org.uk/uploads/assets/f08a1429-1e0b-45ab-857bfd085549f0fb/Advice-Notice-The-marketing-of-Gambling-on-eSports-on-Social-Media.pdf">a
      reminder</a> of the advertising rules, and <a
      href="https://www.asa.org.uk/resource/cap-s-response-to-gambleaware-s-research-on-social-media-marketing-for-esports-gambling.html">published
      a response</a> to the findings pointing out that many tweets were from non-UK operators and therefore beyond
      the remit of the CAP code.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, we found that it is possible in many cases for children to click through to non-UK sites and open
      accounts by saying they are 18, highlighting a major effectiveness issue with a UK-focused code in a world of
      international social media. We also believe that the ASA needs to call more UK transgressors to account with
      sanctions for those who fail to comply.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our view, the rules do not adequately address the peculiarities of social-media marketing, where funny content
      can quickly and effectively make esports betting more appealing to children and normalise the link between
      popular games and gambling. An awareness campaign for parents is also needed. Many parents might know that their
      children are playing esports in their bedrooms or following professional tournaments, but most are probably
      unaware of the strong link with betting. Last but not least, we also need a lot more research.

          We are committed to driving up standards in the betting and gaming industry. It is illegal for anyone under 18
          to bet with any of our members and we operate strict age and identification measures to prevent anyone
          underage accessing these products.

      <p>
        <i>
          We have also taken further steps to prevent young people from seeing betting adverts. From October 1, the
          updated industry code for socially responsible advertising means that all sponsored or paid-for adverts on
          search engines must make clear the products are only for those aged over 18, while YouTube users will need
          to have age-verified accounts before they can view betting adverts. BGC members will also have to frequently
          post responsible betting messages on their Twitter accounts.

      <p>
        <i>
          We look forward to the government‚Äôs forthcoming gambling review, which we hope will lead to a crackdown on
          black market operators who have no interest in safer gambling or protecting their customers and do not work
          to the same responsible standards as BGC members.

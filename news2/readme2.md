# The Neighbourhood newspaper - second article

To response to the task of the Week 02 I used an article of The Beatles that I found in The Conversation website. [This](https://theconversation.com/two-of-us-inside-john-lennons-incredible-songwriting-partnership-with-paul-mccartney-147857) is the link.

**I matched everything using a CSS file that I build in Visual Studio Code, making a comparison and carefuly following, step by step and pixel by pixel, the style in the original article, as required.**

**I worked with tools like 'class', 'div', 'span', 'hover' and others. Those helped me to build a similar article, according to the task required. Also, I used the stylesheet in the first article, that is included in this repository**

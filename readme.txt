# The Neighbourhood newspaper

###### To response to the task of the Week 01 I used an article of e-sports that I found in The Conversation website.  [This] (https://theconversation.com/esports-could-be-quietly-spawning-a-whole-new-generation-of-problem-gamblers-147124) is the link.

*** After watching the Git tutorial and learned how to use Github, I started working in Visual 
Studio Code and, step by step, checked that everything matched with the selected article. 
After every significative progress, I used Git comands in PowerShell to commit and push everything to the Github repositoriy. ***

*** The chosen article has an important amount of tweets and links that made me concentrate in keeping 
a clean code in VS Code. Also, there was photos and a video, according to the task required. ***
